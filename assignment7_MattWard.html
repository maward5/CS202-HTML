      <p> I have found that I enjoy programming classes, and programming has become fun. 
          As an electrical engineer, I wish there were better classes dedicated to HDL's as I am using them more than I expected.
          Computers will play a prominent role in my career moving foreward, and I am excited to learn and contribute new things as
          computing technology improves.
