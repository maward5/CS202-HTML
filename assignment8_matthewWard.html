  <p style = "font-style:italic; color:#FFFFFF">An audio design engineer designs speakers, microphones and manipulitive equipment to create PA systems for different venues.
  In addition, they need to understand acoustics and music to accurately convey the artist's work to the audience. Most design engineers
  should make around 75k per year, and bring joy to the masses throught the power of music.</p><br>
  <p style = "font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF">The calrec board company is based out of southern england. I think it would be very interesting to work abroad for a few years
   and get to experience a different culture than I'm accustomed to. I think that given my unique experiences with music and the 
   degree that I'm getting, I should have a pretty good chance of landing a job anywhere.</p><br>
