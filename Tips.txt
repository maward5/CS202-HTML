Submitting .html through BB submit for archive purposes.

HTML is a markup language using tags and attributes to define the appearance of
a website. Paragraph Tags open and close <p></p> like quotes.

<br> is a newline;

Tags can be nested.
Attributes add information to the content. Some of them are optional, some of
them aren't. Image attributes usually aren't.

Always save as .html

Save to desktop for easier submission.
